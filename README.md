# Wav2Lip-HD: Improving Wav2Lip to achieve High-Fidelity Videos

This repository contains code for achieving high-fidelity lip-syncing in videos, using the [Wav2Lip algorithm](https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip) for lip-syncing and the [Real-ESRGAN algorithm](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN) for super-resolution. The combination of these two algorithms allows for the creation of lip-synced videos that are both highly accurate and visually stunning.

## Algorithm

The algorithm for achieving high-fidelity lip-syncing with Wav2Lip and Real-ESRGAN can be summarized as follows:

1. The input video and audio are given to `Wav2Lip` algorithm.
2. Python script is written to extract frames from the video generated by wav2lip.
3. Frames are provided to Real-ESRGAN algorithm to improve quality.
4. Then, the high-quality frames are converted to video using ffmpeg, along with the original audio.
5. The result is a high-quality lip-syncing video.
6. The specific steps for running this algorithm are described in the [Testing Model](https://github.com/saifhassan/Wav2Lip-HD#testing-model) section of this README.

## Testing Model

To test the "Wav2Lip-HD" model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository and install requirements using following command (Make sure, Python and CUDA are already installed):

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/saifhassan/Wav2Lip-HD.git
    cd Wav2Lip-HD
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. Downloading weights

3. Put input video to `input_videos` directory and input audio to `input_audios` directory.
4. Open `run_final.sh` file and modify following parameters:
 
     `filename=kennedy` (just video file name without extension)
     
     `input_audio=input_audios/ai.wav` (audio filename with extension)

5. Execute `run_final.sh` using following command:

    ```
    bash run_final.sh
    ```
    
6. Outputs

- `output_videos_wav2lip` directory contains video output generated by wav2lip algorithm.
- `frames_wav2lip` directory contains frames extracted from video (generated by wav2lip algorithm).
- `frames_hd` directory contains frames after performing super-resolution using Real-ESRGAN algorithm.
- `output_videos_hd` directory contains final high quality video output generated by Wav2Lip-HD.


## Results
The results produced by Wav2Lip-HD are in two forms, one is frames and other is videos. Both are shared below:
